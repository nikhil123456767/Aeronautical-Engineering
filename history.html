            <h2>History of Aeronautical Engineering</h2>
            <p>The history of aeronautical engineering can be traced back to the early concepts of flight. The first successful powered flight was achieved by the Wright brothers in 1903, marking a significant milestone in the field.</p>
            <p>Throughout the 20th century, aeronautical engineering evolved rapidly with advancements in materials, propulsion systems, and aerodynamics. Key milestones include the introduction of the jet engine in the 1940s and the development of supersonic aircraft in the 1950s.</p>
            <p>Significant events in aeronautical engineering history include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1903: First powered flight by the Wright brothers</li>
                <li>1914: First commercial airline flight</li>
                <li>1939: Introduction of the first jet aircraft</li>
                <li>1947: Chuck Yeager breaks the sound barrier</li>
                <li>1969: First flight of the Boeing 747</li>
