            <h2>Mechanisms in Aeronautical Engineering</h2>
            <p>Aeronautical mechanisms are essential for the functionality and control of aircraft. Understanding how these mechanisms work is crucial for any aspiring engineer in the field.</p>
            <h3>Aerodynamic Principles</h3>
            <p>The principles of aerodynamics govern how aircraft interact with the air. Key concepts include lift, drag, and thrust, which are fundamental to flight. Lift is generated by the wings as air flows over and under them, creating a pressure differential.</p>
            <p>Drag, on the other hand, opposes the aircraft's forward motion, influenced by the shape of the aircraft and its speed. Engineers must design aircraft to minimize drag while maximizing lift for efficient flight.</p>

            </div>

            <h3>Control Surfaces</h3>
            <p>Control surfaces, such as ailerons, elevators, and rudders, play a vital role in maneuvering the aircraft. Each control surface adjusts the aircraft's orientation and trajectory during flight.</p>
            <p>Ailerons are located on the trailing edge of the wings and control roll, allowing the aircraft to bank left or right. Elevators, found on the tail, control pitch, affecting the aircraft's ascent or descent. The rudder, positioned on the vertical stabilizer, controls yaw, which helps the aircraft turn left or right.</p>

            </div>

            <h3>Landing Gear Mechanism</h3>
            <p>The landing gear system is designed for safe takeoffs and landings. It incorporates mechanisms for extending and retracting the gear, as well as shock absorption during landing. Modern landing gear systems often include sensors to monitor the condition and position of the gear.</p>
            <p>The design of the landing gear must consider factors such as weight, aerodynamics, and the terrain on which the aircraft will operate. Different types of landing gear include tricycle gear, tailwheel gear, and skids for helicopters.</p>

                <button onclick="alert('Understand landing gear design!')">Learn More</button>
            </div>

            <h3>Engine Mechanisms</h3>
            <p>The engine mechanisms, whether jet or propeller-driven, convert fuel into thrust. Understanding how these mechanisms function is critical for aeronautical engineers.</p>
            <p>Jet engines operate on the principle of Newton's third law, producing thrust by expelling exhaust gases at high speed. In contrast, propeller-driven aircraft use blades to generate lift and thrust through rotational motion.</p>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="flow pic 13.jpg" alt="c" />
                <button onclick="alert('Discover engine mechanisms!')">Learn More</button>
            </div>

            <p>Overall, a deep understanding of these mechanisms enables engineers to design more efficient and effective aircraft, contributing to advancements in aviation technology.</p>
            <p>As we move forward, innovations in materials and technology will continue to enhance the performance and safety of aircraft.</p>
