            <h2>Basic Parts of an Aircraft</h2>
            <p>An aircraft is composed of various components, each playing a vital role in its operation. Understanding these parts is essential for anyone studying aeronautical engineering.</p>
            <h3>1. Wings</h3>
            <p>The wings are crucial for generating lift. They are designed to create a pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces, allowing the aircraft to ascend and maintain altitude.</p>
            <p>The shape and design of wings, known as airfoils, play a significant role in the efficiency and performance of an aircraft. The angle of attack, or the angle between the wing and the oncoming air, affects lift and drag.</p>

                <button onclick="alert('Learn more about wing design!')">Learn More</button>
            </div>
            <p>The wing's structure includes spars, ribs, and a skin that work together to withstand aerodynamic forces during flight. Modern wings may also incorporate winglets to reduce drag and improve fuel efficiency.</p>

            <h3>2
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="aero pic 2.jpg" alt="Fuselage Structure" />
                <button onclick="alert('Discover the fuselage structure!')">Learn More</button>
            </div>
            <p>In addition to structural support, the fuselage also contains systems for fuel, avionics, and environmental control, making it a complex engineering challenge.</p>

            <h3>3. Empennage</h3>
            <p>The empennage, or tail assembly, provides stability and control. It consists of the horizontal stabilizer and vertical stabilizer, which help maintain the aircraft's flight attitude.</p>
            <p>Elevators are attached to the horizontal stabilizer, allowing the pilot to control the pitch of the aircraft, while the rudder, attached to the vertical stabilizer, controls yaw.</p>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="aero pic 3.jpg" alt="Empennage Structure" />
                <button onclick="alert('Learn more about the empennage!')">Learn More</button>
            </div>
            <p>Understanding the functionality and design of the empennage is crucial for ensuring that the aircraft remains stable during various phases of flight.</p>

            <h3>4. Landing Gear</h3>
            <p>The landing gear supports the aircraft during takeoff and landing. It includes wheels and brakes to allow safe ground operations. The design of the landing gear must consider factors such as weight, aerodynamics, and the terrain on which the aircraft will operate.</p>
            <p>Landing gear can be fixed or retractable, with the latter being designed to minimize drag during flight.</p>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="aero pic 4.jpg" alt="Landing Gear Structure" />
                <button onclick="alert('Learn about landing gear systems!')">Learn More</button>
            </div>
            <p>The shock-absorbing mechanisms in landing gear are critical for ensuring that the aircraft can land safely and efficiently, reducing stress on the airframe and passengers.</p>

            <h3>5. Powerplant</h3>
            <p>The powerplant provides thrust for the aircraft, typically in the form of jet engines or propellers. Understanding the mechanics of these engines is crucial for aeronautical engineers.</p>
            <p>Jet engines operate on the principle of Newton's third law, producing thrust by expelling exhaust gases at high speed. In contrast, propeller-driven aircraft use blades to generate lift and thrust through rotational motion.</p>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="aero pic.5.jpg" alt="Powerplant Structure" />
                <button onclick="alert('Discover the powerplant mechanics!')">Learn More</button>
            </div>
            <p>Each type of engine has its advantages and applications, influencing the design and performance of the aircraft. Engineers must consider factors such as fuel efficiency, power output, and environmental impact when selecting powerplants.</p>

            <p>Each of these components works in harmony to ensure the aircraft operates safely and efficiently. The complexity of modern aircraft necessitates a thorough understanding of each part and its interaction with others.</p>
            <p>As technology evolves, so too will the design and function of aircraft components, leading to innovations that enhance performance and sustainability.</p>
