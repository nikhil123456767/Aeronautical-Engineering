            <h2>Diagrams and Pictures in Aeronautical Engineering</h2>
            <p>Visual aids such as diagrams and pictures play a vital role in understanding complex engineering concepts. They provide clarity and help illustrate how different components and systems work together.</p>
            <h3>Types of Diagrams</h3>
            <p>Common diagrams used in aeronautical engineering include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Structural Diagrams:</strong> Illustrate the layout and components of aircraft, showcasing the relationships between various parts.</li>
                <li><strong>Aerodynamic Diagrams:</strong> Show airflow patterns around an aircraft, critical for understanding lift and drag.</li>
                <li><strong>System Diagrams:</strong> Detail various systems within the aircraft, such as the electrical or hydraulic systems, and how they interact with each other.</li>
            </ul>
